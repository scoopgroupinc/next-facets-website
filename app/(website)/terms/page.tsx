            If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
            negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
            below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
            arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD
            HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The
            arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial
            Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
            and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for
            Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are

            and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the
            AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA
            Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through
            the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator
            will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of
            reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow
            applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator
            fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable
            AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in
            United States, California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
            Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
            proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or
            enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

            If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
            arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the
            state and federal courts located in United States, California, and
            the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of
            personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to
            venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application
            of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International

            way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause
            of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or
            unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
            Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
            illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a

            Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
            permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
            proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
            arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action

            These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us

            agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use

            Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We
            may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any
            time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
            delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
            control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of
            Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
            provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these

            have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack
            of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.
